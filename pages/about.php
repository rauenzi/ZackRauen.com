									<p>Zack grew up with a love of computers. He started programming when he was only 10 years old and hasn't stopped since.
										3 years later, when he was 13, he built his first PC. And in that same year, he had his first published website
										with a functional login and profile system. </p>
									<br />
									<p>While he was young, he focused mainly on web programming and learned majority of the popular web languages of the
										time such as (X)HTML, CSS, PHP/MySQL and a familiarity with Javascript. Developing web applications in PHP sparked
										his interest in non-web based programming. From there he started learning C/C++/C# and Java but had mainly focused
										on C++. He made several little console games such as Connect Four or Tic-Tac-Toe. It was also around this time
										that his interest in game development was sparked. He, and a couple of friends, developed a very small Sonic The
										Hedgehog fangame using something Called "Gamemaker" by YoYo Games. While the gamemaker engine did the blunt of
										the work. The game logic and basic graphic (sprite) handling was done by Zack and Andrew, a dynamic duo at the
										time.</p>
									<br />
									<p>Upon entering High School, however, programming went on the back-burner for a short while. During this programming
										hiatus, Zack explored his interest in electronics and computer hardware. Under the guidance of his teacher, Mr.
										Eagle, he learned how to work with basic electronics as basic as a light with a switch up to generic house wiring
										and safety principles. He also went on to digital electronics, adding logic design and basic robotics to his already
										formidable arsenal. He even built a little robot that seemed to wander aimlessly through the room, but anytime
										it came close to running into something, it was programmed to detect it and move away. He also learned a few other
										neat things that would help him later on such as Photoshop and graphic design, Human-Computer Interaction (HCI)
										principles as well as woodworking and product design.</p>
